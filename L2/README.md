# L2

A collection of worksheets on linear regression with ridge (L2) regularization. These are
adapted from a tutorial I gave at the [LSST Data Science Fellowship Program
session](https://github.com/LSSTC-DSFP/LSSTC-DSFP-Sessions/tree/master/Session9) at the Flatiron Institute in September 2019.

To generate the datasets needed to run this notebook, run

```
./generate.sh
```

on the command line. You'll need ``nbconvert`` to be installed.
