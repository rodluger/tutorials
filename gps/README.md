A collection of worksheets introducing Gaussian Processes, how to
construct them, draw from them, and perform inference with them. These are
adapted from a tutorial I gave at the [LSST Data Science Fellowship Program
session](https://github.com/LSSTC-DSFP/LSSTC-DSFP-Sessions/tree/master/Session9) at Carnegie Melon in June 2019.
