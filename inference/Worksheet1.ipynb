There's just a single large spot on one side of the star, so we're going to model it with a versy simple sine curve. Let's assume we know everything else about the sine curve (the amplitude, phase, and offset). Here is the function we're going to use to fit the dataset:\n\n$\nm(P) = 1 + 0.1 \\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{P} t\\right)\n$\n\nwhere $m$ is the model, $P$ is the period, and $t$ is time."}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}, "source": "## 1.

In reality, we will *never* know the true value of the star's period because our measurements are noisy and our models are always *approximations* of what's actually going on. What we can do, instead, is to figure out some reasonable bounds on the true answer. We will do this by computing the *likelihood* $\\mathcal{L}$, which in this case is just\n\n$\n\\mathcal{L} = \\mathrm{e}^{-\\frac{1}{2}\\chi^2}\n$\n\nStore the array of likelihoods in the variable ``likelihood`` and plot the likelihood as a function of period.

We'll do this as follows:\n\n```python\ncoeff, _ = curve_fit(Gaussian, periods, likelihood, p0=p0)\nmu, sigma = coeff\n```\n\nwhere ``p0 = [mu0, sigma0]`` is an array corresponding to initial guesses for ``mu`` and ``sigma``.
